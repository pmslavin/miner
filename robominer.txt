Pulse - small radius seismic survey reveals minerals in local area.  Stored in local map.

Minerals are prioritised by value.

Unit can Move left, right, up, down and Drill left, right, up down.

Unit can Gather mineral it occupies the same coord as.

Unit has finite mineral storage capacity.  Must return to surface to unload.

Unit has finite energy capacity. Pulse, Drill, Move, and Gather all have energy cost.  Must return to surface to recharge.

In absence of minerals in local map, unit will explore, prioritising existing channels.
